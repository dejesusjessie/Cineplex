# Movie_Tickets_Reservation_Systems_Project

There are three phases of the "Movies Tickets Reservation Systems Project" for the Database Systems Design course project 
in Fall 2022 at The University of Washington Tacoma. 
Phase III works on creating the conceptual model of the database and developing a functional front end of the database application 
to demonstrate the significant functionalities. 

## The objectives of our project are:
1. An online movie ticket booking system facilitates booking movie tickets for customers/members.
2. The E-ticketing system allows customers to browse through movies currently playing and book seats anywhere and anytime.
3. The movie ticket booking system is changing dynamically.

## Audience:
1. Customer
2. Guest
3. Admin

## Features
1. All members can view movie schedules, book, and cancel tickets.
2. All guests can see the "Now Playing” movie list, but they cannot book the ticket without logging in.
3. Admin has responsibility for adding new movie data, managing movie showtimes, and canceling any movie or show.
